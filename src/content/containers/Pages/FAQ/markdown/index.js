## Signup Process

### What questions do you ask?
We ask the following when you sign-up:
* The country you work in
* The month and year in which you were born
* Your gender
* Your ethnicity
* The company you work at, your pay grade at that company and some key dates
* We may also ask you some company-specific questions

### Why do you need my payslip?
One of our core principles is accuracy - we want to be different than other companies by having real data that you can trust. As a result, we require at least one payslip from you in order to make our system work, however we let you remove any sensitive information - we only need Gross Salary, Company Name and Payslip Date.

Once we have processed your payslip, we delete it - we only store those 3 pieces of information, not the picture of the payslip.

### Is it 'legal' for me to give you my payslip?
The Equality Act 2010 protects pay disclosures to a relevant person or company if you are trying to find out if you are being discriminated against. It also made 'gagging orders' in contracts that say you can't disclose your pay unenforceable.

For a more detailed analysis read [this blog](https://medium.com/sliips-thoughts/am-i-allowed-to-disclose-my-payslip-to-external-organisations-like-sliips-88dbd4ab08a0#.4rccfsqbo) from Employment Lawyer, [Louise Taft](https://twitter.com/Louise_Taft) from [Freemans Solicitors](http://www.freemanssolicitors.net/site/people/profile/lt)


### How long does it take to get access to data?
Once you submit your payslip it usually takes 5 minutes to get access while our system processes the payslip. It could take longer if the payslip is very different to others we have seen before.


## The Data

### What data can I see?
By default, you can see any data that we have for the market, referred to as Market Data. You can also explore all of the data we have for your company. If you wish to unlock more data about other companies, you can spend Sliips Points to do so, which is fully explained [here](/sliips-points).

### What is Market Data?
Data relating to jobs, industries and any other metric that we can compare reliably between companies.

### What is Company Data?
Data relating to a specific company. We provide several different ways of analysing company data.


## About Sliips

### What is Sliips?
Sliips is a platform for sharing salary information in an accurate and anonymous way. We have a full page explaining the company [here](/about-us), we also explain our revenue model there as we want to be open with you about what we do with your data.

### Why did you start Sliips?
We started sliips for a bunch of reasons, but the main ones are:
* We realised that there is no easy and reliable way to find out if you are paid fairly
* We believe that pay transparency is good for employees and employers alike and will help solve discriminatory issues
* There is no tool to actually help people understand what a career move might mean, and when one might be needed


### How is Sliips different to other services?
We know there are loads of other services that offer salary comparison. We are different because:
* We have real data to enable real insight
* We won't sell your data to recruiters so you get a bunch of emails constantly asking you about an 'exciting opportunity' at an 'exciting client'

### What are Sliips Points?
Sliips works with your data. In order to get as much as possible to provide the best possible analytics, we have a points system. By default you will only have access to Market Data and data at companies you have submitted payslips for. If you want access to detailed analytics at companies you do not work at, you need to spend Sliips Points which you can either earn or buy - a full explanation is available [here](/sliips-points)


## Privacy

### How do you keep my data safe?
There are multiple methods we use internally to keep your data safe, and we follow best practice in terms of technical and process security - but the most important thing you need to understand is that we only take data that is required. For instance, we never store your first and last name, even if you leave them visible on your payslip. We have a page that goes into detail about privacy [here](/privacy)`;
